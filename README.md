# USER GUIDE

Hello, and welcome to our Stock Market Simulator CLI.

You are a new trader and it's your first day on the job. Your goal is to check through a list of stocks and build out a Portfolio for your firm.

Make sure to not spend all your money at once or go bankrupt!

### Necessary Files

### Stocks List and Codes

When choosing your stocks, you'll have to use the official stock exchange TICKER. This is the 2-4 letter character code listed alongside each of the stocks in the stock list.
